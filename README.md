# Job-Aggregator

## Aggregate New Job Positions:

This project involves a program that uses APIs to communicate to job listing websites, extracts new posts, and aggregates them for the user. 

### Developer Stories:

1. **As a developer***, I want the program to run periodically even while my computer is off.
2. **As a developer**, I want the program to aggregate new job postings it finds through the algorithm I specify.
  - For now, access one online job aggregator using an API.
  -  Periodically, access new job postings.
  -   Take X amount of new job postings and aggregate them for the developer to view.
3. **As a developer**, I want the program to store these new job postings in a tidy array.
