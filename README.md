# Job-Aggregator

## Aggregate New Job Positions:

This project involves a program that uses APIs to communicate to job listing websites, extracts new posts, and aggregates them for the user. 

### Developer Stories:

1. **As a developer***, I want the program to run every X minutes even while my computer is off. 
2. **As a developer**, I want the program to aggregate X new job postings it finds.
    - For now, access one online job aggregator using an API.
    - Take Y amount of new job postings and aggregate them every X minutes. 
3. **As a developer**, I want the program to store these new job postings in a tidy array.
